"""
Token accounting for the book's build, with no trace in the teaching code.

Python imports `sitecustomize` automatically at interpreter startup when it is on the
path. `code/_runner.py` puts `code/` on PYTHONPATH; nothing else does. So when the build
runs a listing, every model call is counted — and when a *reader* runs the same listing,
this file is never imported and the listing behaves exactly as printed in the book.

That property is the point. Instrumenting the listings themselves would mean the code in
the book is not the code that runs.

Almost nothing in this book calls a language model. Chapter 20 does, when it compares a
trained ticket classifier with a prompted model on cost per 1,000 tickets, and those are
the calls counted here. If the `openai` package is not installed, this does nothing.
